Data from a Phase 1 and baseline survey of two sites on Arran.

# Data Management Plan
### Types of data generated
A Phase 1 habitat survey habitat map with target notes on notable plant and animal species. A data table of animal survey results and the code used to normalise and analyse it.
### Types of data preserved
All of the above and the components used to generate it.
### Software and metadata implications
The data table and analysis code will be readable in R.
### Length of data preservation
10 years.
### Value of data to others
The table of animal survey data is informative as to the presence of animal species in the area, as is the habitat map.
### How data will be shared
All data (the data table, code used to analyse it and habitat maps produced alongside their target notes) will be uploaded to GitHub with a README file explaining each file's purpose.
### Resources needed to preserve and share data
None, depending on GitHub's own resources and decisions.
