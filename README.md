Data from a Phase 1 and baseline survey of two sites on Arran.

# Contents
`Arran.xlsx` - Dataset in the Darwin Core Standard format

`Habitat Map.png` - Phase 1 habitat map that was produced

`biodiversity.R` - R code used to analyse data and generate graphs in `graphs/`

`GBIF_taxonomy.R` - R code to standardise names to the GBIF backbone

#### `graphs/`
`allranks.png` - Alpha diversity at each taxonomic rank for both sites separately and together.

`habitatdissimilarity.png` - Sørensen dissimilarity between the two sites at the order level for bracken, grassland, stream and woodland habitats.

`rankdissimilarity.png` - Sørensen dissimilarity between the two sites at each taxonomic rank.

`siteranks.png` - Alpha diversity at the order, family, genus and species taxonomic ranks per habitat for both sites separately and together.

# Data Management Plan
### Types of data generated
A Phase 1 habitat survey habitat map with target notes on notable plant and animal species. A data table of animal survey results and the code used to normalise and analyse it.

### Types of data preserved
All of the above and the components used to generate it.

### Software and metadata implications
The data table and analysis code will be readable in R.

### Length of data preservation
10 years.

### Value of data to others
The table of animal survey data is informative as to the presence of animal species in the area, as is the habitat map.

### How data will be shared
All data (the data table, code used to analyse it and habitat maps produced alongside their target notes) will be uploaded to GitHub with a README file explaining each file's purpose.

### Resources needed to preserve and share data
None, depending on GitHub's own resources and decisions.
